I like games about economics. I like to own a blacksmith or shop to manage and improve. So I have decided to try and create my own game combining those two concepts.

This is not finished project. THe idea is that a player has a shop where player can sell items forged by player. I have worked on this project for one and a half week a few hours per day.
