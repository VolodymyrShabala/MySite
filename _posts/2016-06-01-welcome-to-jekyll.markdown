During 4 weeks of game development using Unreal and C++ I and my group developed coop puzzle 2.5D game.

During the project I created menu system, camera but my main focus was on code refactoring. During week two when all the important mechanics were implemented I started refactoring the code for easier bug fixing, to easier read code and easier time implementing future features.

Code samples comming soon. But you can download and play the game in the link down below.
