During 4 weeks of game development using Unreal and C++ I and my group developed coop puzzle 2.5D game.

During the project I worked on camera, menu, tutorial etc. But my main focus was on code refactoring and bug fixing. During week two when all the important mechanics were implemented I started refactoring the code for easier bug fixing, to easier read code and easier time implementing future features.

Code samples comming soon. But you can download and play the game in the link down below.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
